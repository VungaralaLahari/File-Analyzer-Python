#  File Text Analyzer using Python

This project is a simple Python-based text analyzer that reads a text file and extracts useful information such as the number of lines, words, characters, word frequencies, and the most frequently used words.

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals, string handling, file operations, and dictionary-based logic.

- Counts the total number of lines in the file  
- Counts the total number of words  
- Counts the total number of characters  
- Cleans the text by removing punctuation and converting it to lowercase  
- Calculates the frequency of each word  
- Displays the most frequently used words
